## Introduction:
Weather forecasting is the application of current technology and science to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and location. Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. However, not all of these predictions prove reliable. Here is the need of this system which will predict weather details based on parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind by just entering the location.


## Objective:
Weather Forecast is a web based system. On an everyday basis many people uses weather forecast to know about weather so the objective of this project is to predict the weather for the users who uses weather application in their laptops, tabs and mobiles. Its goal is to predict the state of the atmosphere and temperature for a given location based on parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind.


## Technologies Used:
#### This system is developed with a front-end technologies.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
- JS (JavaScript)
- Bootstrap

## Team Contribution:
- Unnati Goyal : Landing Page, Share Popup Page
- Roshni Rawat : Privacy Policy Page, Black White Mode
- Nandinee Gupta : Weather Card of Homepage , Google Map Page
- Saumya Gupta : 5 Day Forcasting Page, Feedback Popup, Homepage


## Applications
#### This project helps people for the following ways-:
- Helps businesses and people plan for power production and how much power to use (i.e. power companies, where to set thermostat).
- Helps people prepare if they need to take extra gear to prepare for the weather (i.e. umbrella, rain coat, sun screen)
- Helps farmers and gardeners plan for crop irrigation and protection (irrigation scheduling, freeze protection)
- Helps people plan outdoor activities (i.e. to see if rain/storms/cold weather will impact outdoor event).
- Helps people with health related issues to plan the day (i.e. allergies, asthma, heat stress)
- This system can also be used in Air Traffic, Marine, Agriculture, Forestry, Military, and Navy etc.


## Limitations:
#### Weather forecasts still have their limitations despite the use of modern technology.
- Weather forecasing is complex and not always accurate especially for days further in the future because, the weather can be unpredictable.
- These weather forecast website uses something called an API, or an application programming interface to retrieve the data so sometimes API will not work properly because of lack of documentation.
